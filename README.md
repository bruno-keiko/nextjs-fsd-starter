### Getting started

#### Option 1: Using the CLI (Recommended)

```bash
npx next-fsd my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Option 2: Clone and Install

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
npm install
```

For your information, all dependencies are updated every month.

Then, you can run the project locally in development mode with live reload by executing:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project. For your information, the project is already pre-configured with a local database using PGlite. No extra setup is required to run the project locally.

Need advanced features? Extend this starter as needed for your product.

### Set up remote database

The project uses DrizzleORM, a type-safe ORM that is compatible with PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MySQL databases. By default, the project is configured to seamlessly work with PostgreSQL, and you have the flexibility to choose any PostgreSQL database provider of your choice.

When you launch the project locally for the first time, it automatically creates a PostgreSQL database on your local machine. This allows you to work with a PostgreSQL database without Docker or any additional setup.

To set up a remote and production database, you need to create a PostgreSQL database and obtain the connection string. You can use any PostgreSQL database provider of your choice. Copy the connection string and add the `DATABASE_URL` variable to the `.env.local` file.

#### Create a fresh and empty database

If you want to create a fresh and empty database, you just need to remove the folder `local.db` from the root of the project. The next time you run the project, a new database will be created automatically.

### Translation (i18n) setup

For translation, the project uses `next-intl`. You can manage translations by editing the locale files in the `src/shared/config/locales` directory.

### Customization

You can easily configure the starter by searching the entire project for `FIXME:` to make quick customizations. Here are some of the most important files to customize:

- `src/shared/utils/AppConfig.ts`: configuration file
- `src/widgets/base-template/ui/base-template.tsx`: default theme
- `next.config.ts`: Next.js configuration
- `.env`: default environment variables

You have full access to the source code for further customization. The provided code is just an example to help you start your project. The sky's the limit 🚀.

### Change database schema

To modify the database schema in the project, update `./src/entities/counter/model/schema.ts`.

After making changes to the schema, generate a migration by running the following command:

```shell
npm run db:generate
```

This will create a migration file that reflects your schema changes.

After making sure your database is running, you can apply the generated migration using:

```shell
npm run db:migrate
```

There is no need to restart the Next.js server for the changes to take effect.

### Commit Message Format

The project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification, meaning all commit messages must be formatted accordingly. To help you write commit messages, the project provides an interactive CLI that guides you through the commit process. To use it, run the following command:

```shell
npm run commit
```

One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is the ability to automatically generate GitHub releases. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.

### Testing

All unit tests are located alongside the source code in the same directory, making them easier to find. The unit test files follow this format: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`. The project uses Vitest and React Testing Library for unit testing. You can run the tests with the following command:

```shell
npm run test
```

### Integration & E2E Testing

The project uses Playwright for integration and end-to-end (E2E) testing. Integration test files use the `*.spec.ts` extension, while E2E test files use the `*.e2e.ts` extension. You can run the tests with the following commands:

```shell
npx playwright install # Only for the first time in a new environment
npm run test:e2e
```

### Storybook

Storybook is configured for UI component development and testing. The project uses Storybook with Next.js and Vite integration, including accessibility testing and documentation features.

Stories are located alongside your components in the `src` directory and follow the pattern `*.stories.ts` or `*.stories.tsx`.

You can run Storybook in development mode with:

```shell
npm run storybook
```

This will start Storybook on http://localhost:6006 where you can view and interact with your UI components in isolation.

To run Storybook tests in headless mode, you can use the following command:

```shell
npm run storybook:test
```

### Local Production Build

Generate an optimized production build locally using a temporary in-memory Postgres database:

```shell
npm run build-local
```

This command:

- Starts a temporary in-memory Database server
- Runs database migrations with Drizzle Kit
- Builds the Next.js app for production
- Shuts down the temporary DB when the build finishes

Notes:

- By default, it uses a local database, but you can also use `npm run build` with a remote database.
- This only creates the build, it doesn't start the server. To run the build locally, use `npm run start`.

### Deploy to production

During the build process, database migrations are automatically executed, so there's no need to run them manually. However, you must define `DATABASE_URL` in your environment variables.

Then, you can generate a production build with:

```shell
$ npm run build
```

It generates an optimized production build of the boilerplate. To test the generated build, run:

```shell
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local server using the production build. You can now open http://localhost:3000 in your preferred browser to see the result.

### Logging

The project uses LogTape for logging. In the development environment, logs are displayed in the console by default. For production, you can configure additional logging sinks as needed.

### Useful commands

### Code Quality and Validation

The project includes several commands to ensure code quality and consistency. You can run:

- `npm run lint` to check for linting errors
- `npm run lint:fix` to automatically fix fixable issues from the linter
- `npm run check:types` to verify type safety across the entire project
- `npm run check:deps` help identify unused dependencies and files
- `npm run check:i18n` ensures all translations are complete and properly formatted

#### Bundle Analyzer

Next.js Boilerplate includes a built-in bundle analyzer. It can be used to analyze the size of your JavaScript bundles. To begin, run the following command:

```shell
npm run build-stats
```

By running the command, it'll automatically open a new browser window with the results.

#### Database Studio

The project is already configured with Drizzle Studio to explore the database. You can run the following command to open the database studio:

```shell
npm run db:studio
```

Then, you can open https://local.drizzle.studio with your favorite browser to explore your database.

### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode user, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

With the plugins installed in your VSCode, ESLint and Prettier can automatically fix the code and display errors. The same applies to testing: you can install the VSCode Vitest extension to automatically run your tests, and it also shows the code coverage in context.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide-type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.
